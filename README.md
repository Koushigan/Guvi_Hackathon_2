# Guvi_Hackathon_2

Steps Completed:
Backend process completed

I completed the task by 1.30 on 22/11/2022. When I tried to push the source code to Github, received an error message stating that the ssh keys were not defined. Later I generated new keys and added them to the github account.
Again while pushing the code remote origin failed error popped up. Again .git/config file was changed.
finally i was able to push the files but unfortunately api folder isnt opening.
So i added zip file of the source code on the same repository.
